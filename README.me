# Kevin's Dotfiles :fire:
I use [gnu stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles. 

## Usage

Stow is super easy to use:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow _desired_package_
# i.e. stow zsh
```

.stowrc sets the defaults, so we'll need to get that symlinked first. From there, we can run `stow package-name` from ~/ and it'll link properly.
## Inclusions

- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- ~vim~
- neovim
